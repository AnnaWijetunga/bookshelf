# Specifications for the Rails Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Using Ruby on Rails for the project
Yes - Ruby on Rails is the framework for Bookshelf.

- [x] Include at least one has_many relationship (x has_many y; e.g. User has_many Recipes) 
Yes - a book has_many reviews, a genre has_many books, a user has_many reviews.

- [x] Include at least one belongs_to relationship (x belongs_to y; e.g. Post belongs_to User)
Yes - a book belongs_to a genre, a review belongs_to a book and a review belongs_to a user.

- [x] Include at least two has_many through relationships (x has_many y through z; e.g. Recipe has_many Items through Ingredients)
Yes - a book has_many users through reviews, and a user has_many books through reviews.

- [X] Include at least one many-to-many relationship (x has_many y through z, y has_many x through z; e.g. Recipe has_many Items through Ingredients, Item has_many Recipes through Ingredients)
Yes - the reviews table meets this requirement. We have to know what weâ€™re reviewing and who reviewed it and there has to be some information, in this case, the content of the review itself. There are three components: book_id, user_id, and content.

- [x] The "through" part of the has_many through includes at least one user submittable attribute, that is to say, some attribute other than its foreign keys that can be submitted by the app's user (attribute_name e.g. ingredients.quantity)
Yes - the reviews table meets this requirement. We have to know what weâ€™re reviewing and who reviewed it and there has to be some information, in this case, the content of the review itself. There are three components: book_id, user_id, and content.

- [X] Include reasonable validations for simple model objects (list of model objects with validations e.g. User, Recipe, Ingredient, Item)
Yes - the book, genre, review and user models all contain validations. Please see each model for the specifics of each validation/validations, but I believe these are sufficient.

- [X] Include a class level ActiveRecord scope method (model object & class method name and URL to see the working feature e.g. User.most_recipes URL: /users/most_recipes)
Yes - in the book model, there are two scope methods:
    scope :order_by_title, -> {order("title")}
    scope :order_by_author, -> {order("author_last")}

And those scope methods can be found in the static > author and static > title view files.

- [x] Include signup (how e.g. Devise)
Yes - in routes.rb, Session Controller and Sessions Helper you'll find routes and methods for signing up.

- [x] Include login (how e.g. Devise)
Yes - in routes.rb, Session Controller and Sessions Helper you'll find routes and methods for logging in.

- [x] Include logout (how e.g. Devise)
Yes - in routes.rb, Session Controller and Sessions Helper you'll find routes and methods for logging out.

- [x] Include third party signup/login (how e.g. Devise/OmniAuth)
Yes - in routes.rb, Session Controller and Sessions Helper you'll find routes and methods for signing up and logging in via Google with OmniAuth.

- [x] Include nested resource show or index (URL e.g. users/2/recipes)
Yes - in routes.rb, here you'll find the nested resources for books and reviews and the pages they'll route to:

  resources :users do
    resources :books, only: [:index]
    resources :reviews, only: [:new, :create, :show]
  end

- [x] Include nested resource "new" form (URL e.g. recipes/1/ingredients/new)
Yes - in routes.rb, here you'll find the nested resources for books and reviews and the pages they'll route to:

  resources :users do
    resources :books, only: [:index]
    resources :reviews, only: [:new, :create, :show]
  end
- [ ] Include form display of validation errors (form URL e.g. /recipes/new)

Confirm:
- [x] The application is pretty DRY
Yes - I believe so! I'm sure there's always refactoring that could be done, but I'm happy with this for now!

- [x] Limited logic in controllers
Yes - I tried to help keep logic minimal in controllers via helper methods and partials.

- [x] Views use helper methods if appropriate
Yes - SessionsHelpers were important for all login/logout, signup and google signup/signin info - sessions information.

- [x] Views use partials if appropriate
Yes - in particular, partials for error messages and user links (found in views > layouts > shared folders). Also partials for the footer, header and the main form (found in views > layouts folders).
